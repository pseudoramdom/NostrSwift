# ⁕Spore⁕

A simple Swift implementation of the [Nostr protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr). 

⚠️ This is a pre-alpha software made for the sole purpose of understanding the Nostr protocol. By no means is this ready for production-level code.

## Getting Started
Spore primarily uses Swift Package Manager as its build tool.
You can add this package directly from Xcode by going to `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency` and entering the repository URL.
You may also add it to your `Package.swift` file - 

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/pseudoramdom/Spore.git")
```
